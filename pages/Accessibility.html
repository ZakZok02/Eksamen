                <p>
                    <br> We conducted an automated test using the lighthouse Chrome DevTools browser extension.
                    <br> 
                    The results revealed several areas for improvement. The automated test tools cannot catch all accessibility issues. So we used manual testing and published our code public to ensure comprehensive accessibility, and to
                    see if it is needed improvement.

                    <h3>Universal design choices beyond automated testing.</h3>
                        <p>
                            We implemented several coding choices that go beyond what automated tests can
                            detect:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Semantic HTML Structure: We prioritized the use of semantic HTML elements
                                to provide a clear document structure to improve screen reader navigation and
                                overall content comprehension.</li>

                            <li>Color Contrast and Text Resizing: We carefully selected color schemes to
                                maintain a minimum contrast ratio for normal text and minimum contrast ratio
                                for large text. Additionally, we used relative units (em and rem) for font sizes to
                                ensure text resizes properly when users adjust their browser settings:</li>
                            
                            <li>
                                ARIA Attributes for Dynamic Content: For dynamic content that can&#39;t be easily
                                conveyed through semantic HTML alone, we utilized ARIA attributes: This
                                ensures that screen reader users are informed of important updates without
                                interrupting their current task.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Image Compression: JPG/PNG to WebP:
                                We have converted images from JPG and PNG formats to WebP which is a vital optimization step for modern web design. 
                                <br>
                                WebP offers superior compression and quality preservation, reducing image file sizes significantly compared to traditional formats. 
                                This improves loading times and overall user experience, especially for mobile users with limited bandwidth.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Overall, by implementing these universal design principles and going beyond
                            automated testing, we strive to create a more inclusive and accessible web
                            experience for all users. And we tested with 4 students to get feedback from them
                            essential components of our ongoing accessibility efforts.
