                    <h2>Visibility and Influence</h2>
                    <p>Qatar, as a small nation, gained significant international visibility and influence by hosting the World Cup. This event allowed them to "punch above their weight" in global affairs. As Danyel Reiche, a visiting associate professor at Georgetown University Qatar, explained: "Qatar is a small state, and for small states, the main objective in international affairs is visibility. Apart from visibility, it's also about having some influence in international affairs and being able to punch above [your] weight". The World Cup provided Qatar with an unprecedented platform to showcase its culture, development, and ambitions on the global stage.<a href="https://www.vox.com/world/23450515/world-cup-fifa-qatar-2022-controversy-scandals-explained">Read more</a></p>

                    <h2>Middle East Representation</h2>
                    <p>The tournament marked the first time a World Cup was held in the Middle East, giving the region a chance to showcase its culture and hospitality. As noted in one report, "Qatar is the first Arab nation, and only nation in Asia to host the FIFA World Cup independently and successfully". This historic event allowed the Arab world to present itself to a global audience, challenging stereotypes and promoting cultural understanding. The success of Morocco's team in reaching the semi-finals further highlighted the region's footballing prowess.<a href="https://www.sikkimexpress.com/news-details/fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022--challenges-and-success">Read More</a></p>

                    <h2>Infrastructure Development</h2>
                    <p>
                        Qatar invested heavily in infrastructure, building new stadiums, hotels, and transportation systems. This development could potentially benefit the country in the long term. According to one source, "Qatar spent an estimated $220 billion on the 2022 FIFA World Cup". This included the construction of seven new stadiums and the renovation of an eighth, as well as significant investments in transportation infrastructure such as the Doha Metro. These developments are expected to contribute to Qatar's long-term economic growth and diversification strategy. <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/2023/04/05/fifa-world-cup-helped-qatars-economy-expand-8-in-fourth-quarter/#:~:text=Robust%20fourth%20quarter%20economic%20activity%20lifted%20Qatar%E2%80%99s%20real,spurred%20tourism%2C%20with%20retail%20and%20hospitality%20also%20benefiting." title="You're about to leave this page" aria-label="Read more about this article">Read more</a>

                    <h2>Economic Boost</h2>
                    <p> The event brought over a million visitors to Qatar, providing a short-term economic boost through increased tourism and consumption. As reported, "Qatar expects 1.5M attendees to the 2022 World Cup". The tournament was expected to add up to $17 billion to Qatar's economy over three years, with additional benefits from increased tourism in the years to come. The retail and hospitality sectors saw significant growth, with hotel occupancy rates reaching 92% during the tournament.

                    <h2>Cost and Sustainability</h2>
                    <p> Qatar spent an unprecedented $220 billion on the World Cup, raising questions about the long-term sustainability and use of the newly built facilities. While some stadiums will be repurposed or reduced in capacity after the tournament, concerns remain about the long-term utility of such massive investments. The high cost has also set a precedent that may be difficult for future host nations to match.

                    <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
                    <p> The massive construction projects and the need to air-condition stadiums in Qatar's hot climate raised concerns about the environmental cost of the event. Despite claims of carbon neutrality, an independent report from Carbon Market Watch concluded that "the World Cup's carbon neutrality claims are 'not credible'". The construction of air-conditioned stadiums and the high number of flights required for fans to attend matches contributed to these environmental concerns.

                    <h2>Human Rights Concerns</h2>
                    <p>
                        The treatment of migrant workers involved in constructing World Cup facilities was a major point of criticism. Reports suggest that thousands of workers died during the preparations. According to an analysis by the Guardian, "at least 6,500 migrant laborers have died in Qatar since the tournament was awarded to the country in 2010". This issue brought international scrutiny to Qatar's labor practices and led to some reforms, including new legislation to protect workers from heat stress and provide more rights to migrant workers.

                    <h2>Cultural Clashes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Qatar's conservative society and strict laws, particularly regarding alcohol and LGBTQ+ rights, created tensions with international visitors and norms. The tournament featured "a total ban on alcohol, making it the first tournament where alcohol was banned"[15]. This decision, along with concerns about LGBTQ+ rights, led to debates about cultural differences and respect for local customs versus international norms.

                    <h2>Corruption Allegations</h2>
                    <p>  There were widespread allegations of corruption in the bidding process that led to Qatar being awarded the World Cup. As noted, "FIFA's choice of Qatar as the 2022 World Cup host was made in 2010 amid widespread allegations of corruption". These allegations led to investigations and reforms within FIFA, including leadership changes and new guidelines for assigning major international tournaments.<a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2022/10/has-the-world-cup-changed-qatar?lang=en" title="You're about to leave this page" aria-label="Read more about this article">Read more</a>
